ðŸŒŸ Thrilled to share a milestone achievement! ðŸŒŸ
I've successfully completed a comprehensive project on the COVID-19 dataset. 

The COVID-19 dataset used in this project includes detailed information on:
â—¾ Total COVID-19 cases
â—¾ Death percentage
â—¾ Total deaths
â—¾ Total cases per 1M population
â—¾ Total deaths per 1M population

âž¡ Extensive data cleaning and preprocessing

ðŸ”¹ Read the data and checked its shape and size
ðŸ”¹ Analyzed the first few rows (head) and last few rows (tail)
ðŸ”¹ Gathered detailed info and statistical information
ðŸ”¹ Identified and addressed missing values
ðŸ”¹ Identified rows with null values, replaced them with suitable values, and performed sanity checks

âž¡Conducted in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

ðŸ”¹ Checked the top 5 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases and plotted a bar chart
ðŸ”¹ Checked the least 5 countries with the lowest number of COVID-19 cases and plotted a bar chart
ðŸ”¹ Plotted bar charts for the top 5 and least 5 countries with the highest and lowest COVID-19 deaths and death percentages
ðŸ”¹ Analyzed and plotted continent-wise COVID-19 cases for the top 5 countries
ðŸ”¹ Explored the relationship between population and total COVID-19 cases using a scatter plot
ðŸ”¹ Used Spearman's rank correlation method to assess the relationship between numerical data

Working on this project allowed me to tackle a real-world dataset, providing a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 scenario and its complexities. It was a pivotal experience that bridged the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application, deepening my grasp of real-world data challenges.
