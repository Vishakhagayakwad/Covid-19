# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of the COVID-19 dataset, focusing on various metrics such as total cases, death percentages, and population-based case statistics. The analysis aims to provide insights into the impact of COVID-19 across different countries and continents, showcasing data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following information:
- Total COVID-19 cases
- Death percentage
- Total deaths
- Total cases per 1M population
- Total deaths per 1M population

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- **Data Reading:** Loaded the dataset and examined its shape and size.
- **Initial Inspection:** Analyzed the first few rows (head) and last few rows (tail) of the dataset.
- **Data Info:** Gathered detailed information and statistical summaries.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Identified and addressed missing values, replacing them with suitable values, and performed sanity checks.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Top and Bottom Countries by Cases:**
  - Identified the top 5 and least 5 countries with the highest and lowest number of COVID-19 cases.
  - Visualized this data using bar charts.
  
- **Top and Bottom Countries by Deaths and Death Percentages:**
  - Analyzed and plotted the top 5 and least 5 countries based on COVID-19 deaths and death percentages.

- **Continent-Wise Analysis:**
  - Analyzed and visualized COVID-19 cases continent-wise, focusing on the top 5 countries within each continent.

- **Population vs. COVID-19 Cases:**
  - Explored the relationship between population and total COVID-19 cases using scatter plots.

- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Utilized Spearman's rank correlation method to assess the relationship between numerical data.

## Results and Insights

The project provided valuable insights into the distribution and impact of COVID-19 across different regions. By analyzing the data, we gained a deeper understanding of how the pandemic has affected various countries and continents. The visualizations and statistical analyses conducted offer a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 scenario.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
